        <h1>Gloucestershire County Cricket confirms plans to sell Bristol County Ground and move out of city.</h1>

    <section>
        <p>After more than 130 years, the future of Gloucestershire County Cricket could now lie outside of Bristol, as
            the club has confirmed plans to sell their famous site in the city.</p>

        <p>The team has been based at the County Ground on Nevil Road in the Horfield area of Bristol since 1889 when
            they were given the land by WG Grace.</p>

        <p>Now, though, it looks as though there could be a big move, with members of the club being invited to
            sessions to discuss the proposals.</p>

        <p>It would see them move to a potential new site with rumors suggesting a new stadium could be built on land
            closer to the M4 in South Gloucestershire.</p>

        <p>Some members had expressed concerns over the traditional features of the current ground, including the WG
            Grace gates. But ITV News West Country has been told that if the club does move, there would be a plan in
            place to move those gates and also to keep some of the historic features as well.</p>

        <p>Potential developers have also indicated that they would look to pay for the construction of that new
            stadium.</p>

        <p>The club is currently in debt and has been running at a loss in recent years. Members today have said they
            were told by club officials that a potential move would help to secure the future of the team
            financially.</p>

        <p>The team has actually sold the ground twice before but invested money to buy it back on both
            occasions.</p>

        <p>Speaking immediately after the meeting, members seemed to be supportive of the proposals but said that more
            detail would be needed.</p>
